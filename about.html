        <p>My name is Philiso Zithwana I live in South Africa from Eastern Cape Province where I completed Grade 12 (matric) in 2017, I moved to KwaZulu-Natal province in Durban for further studies in 2018, it was very difficult for me to find school and my life was uncertain.</p>
        
    
        <p>By the end of 2020, the founder of IT varsity Mr Bilal gave great opportunity to study at IT varsity and completed a System development Certificate in 2021. Unfortunately, I didn’t land a job as a System Developer after completing my studies which baffled me a lot and made me angry because I don’t have any working experience, in 2022 I ended up choosing the job as being Consultant with no tangible.</p>
        



        <p>I had grasped that I didn’t have the time to continue learning new tech and upgrade my skills, so I quit last October. I made myself a promise to learn and grow as a Frontend Developer which means I focus on making websites Interactive.</p>
        


        <P>I seek an internship, freelance or part-time/ full-time occupation that could allow me to grow my professional and personal skills and qualities in an organization that recognizes the value of hard work and trusts me with responsibilities and challenges.</P>
