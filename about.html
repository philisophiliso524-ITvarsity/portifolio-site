After my life was quiet good and I did not know with career to take but I very interested in systems and logic since I was young.</p>

  <p>I met with IT varsity founder Mr Bilal he  gave me the great opportunity to study at IT varsity and completed a System development Certificate and graduated. I didn't land a job as a System Developer after completing my studies. My career took a different turn due to unforeseen opportunities, I got a job from other career field, but I didn't throw the towel. I continued to learn and explore.</p> 
  <p>After sometime I notice there's not enough  time to continue learning new tech skills  and upgrade my self, so I quitted that Job. I made myself a promise to learn and grow as a in tech industry and focus polishing my skills and also  help upcoming  business</p>

  <p>I'm  seeking a new challenging opportunity in a orginisation that could allow me to grow accomplish my potential  that recognizes the value of persistent and trust me with responsibilities to help them grow by utilizing my skills.</p>
