      <p>My name is Philiso Zithwana I was born and raised in Eastern Cape  where I finished  high school grades and move to KwaZulu-Natal province in Durban for further studies. By that time my life was uncertain not knowing with career path to take but I had deep fond in systems and logic since I was young.</p>

  <p>I met with IT varsity founder Mr Bilal he  gave me the great opportunity to study at IT varsity and completed a System development Certificate and graduated. I didn't land a job as a System Developer after completing my studies. My career took a different turn due to unforeseen opportunities, I got a job from other career field, but I didn't throw the towel. I continued to learn and explore.</p> 
  <p>After sometime I notice there's not enough  time to continue learning new tech skills  and upgrade myself, so I quitted that Job. Thats when I dicided I won't stop learning  and  polishing my skills even though it might be dfficult sometimes I mustn't lose hope.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Luckily Mr Bilal call me and offer  me freelance job to create a Structural design for students and Develop web when needed also I got time to help upcoming businesses introduce them in Digital world. </p>
  <p>I'm  seeking a new challenging opportunity in a orginisation that could allow me to grow accomplish my potential  that recognizes the value of persistent and trust me with responsibilities to help them grow by utilizing my skills.</p>
